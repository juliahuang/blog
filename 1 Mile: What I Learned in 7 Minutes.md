# 1 Mile: What I Learned in 7 Minutes

I was rounding the final runway of my fourth and final lap, giving it my all. After months of consistent training, I was ready to achieve a goal I had set for myself nearly six years prior - the sub-seven minute mile. I had never identified with or been perceived as a runner or an athlete, and this was a big deal.

And when I finally sprinted past the starting point and stopped my watch, I checked the numbers flashing on the screen: 7:00.9. Less than a second away, but I didn't make it. We don't hear nearly enough about the misses along the way, even though they happen all the time. But missing our goals and feeling like a failure is missing the point. We might not end up where we thought we would, but how we got there always teaches us more than we expect.

**It's hard to start, but it gets easier**

The hardest step in starting something different is.... starting. There are so many unknowns. What am I getting myself into? How hard is it going to be? What if I put in the work and I don't get what I hope to achieve? Running is no exception. The first week I started running I was riding a wave of excitement. But even so, the first few runs really did a number on me. I remember what was supposed to be an easy slow 60 minute run during the first week was demoralizing. It was raining, and I was intimidated by the duration of the run. I slowly jogged through the streets, checked out a local farmer's market where one of the vendors cheered me on for running in the rain, and eventually made it back home 45 minutes later, cutting short my planned run. It was not the exact program, but I was just glad I got out there and did it. And as I stuck with running and got into a rhythm over the weeks, I started to look forward to and enjoy the long slow runs.


**It doesn't stay easy**

Relieved that I had gotten past the initial activation energy and I had settled into the swing of things, I thought it would be relatively smooth sailing from there. But it wasn't. By far the biggest hurdle were the speed days. Despite feeling refreshed, and most importantly, proud of myself after each speed run, I would always anticipate how hard it would be and struggle to go outside. My worst day was about 3 weeks in - I had actually gotten into a groove by then, but that day, I sat next to the door, shoes laced on for 20 minutes, just trying to get myself to go. I eventually watched a video that gave me just enough inspiration to get out the door. It wasn't until I had been doing it for 5 weeks that I finally started feeling my reluctance for speed days begin to wane. I was feeling a lot stronger physically, but more surprisingly, I had built a mental strength that I didn't have at the beginning of the program. As the weeks went on, I was excited to see how much I progressed and also ready to see if I was anywhere close to my goal.


**Progress means more than results**

When I missed my target goal by a split second, I was disappointed. To be honest, my motivation plummeted after getting this almost result. Some friends advised me to just count it as an achieved goal, but I knew I could do better. I just wanted to see how I would do if I didn't struggle with pacing and ran it optimally.


I turned to running books as motivation, checking out multiple books on running from the library. One of the passages that stuck to me was from the book 26 Marathons by Meb Keflezighi. "Celebrate every personal best, even if it's only by one second. What does a personal best in running mean? It means you have proof of covering a given distance faster than you ever had in all your time as a runner. That's huge. That's huge in running terms, given how hard we all work and how often obstacles pop up." In blind pursuit of my goal, I had treated my near miss as a complete failure. Looking from the glass full perspective though, I had shaved 30 seconds off my personal best, whether that was 7th grade me, or me from 7 weeks ago, and that was huge!! I loved how this perspective shift changed my "failure" into something to be proud of, and gave me the motivation to keep going.

A few weeks later, I ran and timed my mile again, knowing I would wrap up this chapter no matter the result. This time it wasn't really about the specific goal anymore, I just wanted to see what was the best I could do when I did it to the best of my ability. Over the months I had built up a solid endurance base and pushed myself to run hard into really good shape. This cardio base now allows me to go on long slow runs with friends or push myself a little if I'm feeling ambitious, even though there's no particular goal I'm striving for anymore.

I'm still caught off guard when people call me a "runner". It wasn't something I grew up with, and even though I suppose I could identify as a runner, I took away something much larger than the label of a runner. Instead, I identify more deeply with something all runners and athletes need - consistency. The training of an athlete requires building an insane amount of physical and mental strength, working hard every day consistently to be stronger. I am proud that I can be consistent and I can make a lot of progress when I consistently work toward a goal - in all aspects of life, not just running. Whether it's getting started or continuing to plod on, the journey is never easy, but it will always take me somewhere new.
